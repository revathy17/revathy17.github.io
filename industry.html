		<h1>Industry Experience</h1>
			<p> 
				I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the Machine Learning and Language Technology group at <a href="http://www.factset.com/">FactSet Research Systems</a>. I have worked on many interesting projects end to end from requirements gathering to production release.

			<b>Location:</b> New York, New York <br> <b>Duration: </b> March 2015 – Current <br>
			<ul>
			<li> Worked on predicting shareholder activism in publicly traded companies using factors like pricing, fundamentals and ownership metrics of these companies. Worked end to end from requirements gathering and data collection to production deployment. Key challenges were imbalanced dataset and feature engineering.
			<li> Worked on attribute-value extraction from documents like research reports, press releases and filings using phrase-based classification and NLP techniques. These documents are in free form text format with little structure and involve challenges in terms of inconsistent text layout and varying formats. 
			<li> Worked on mining topic relevant tweets.
