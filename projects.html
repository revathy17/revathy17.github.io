			<h2>1. Location prediction of Twitter Users</h2>
			<p align="justify">
				My <a href="http://wiki.knoesis.org/index.php/Location_Prediction_of_Twitter_Users">thesis</a> is focused on predicting the location of 
				Twitter users at city level using only the contents of their tweets. Existing approaches are purely data-driven and require large training
				data sets of geo-tagged tweets. Furthermore, these approaches rely solely on social media features or probabilistic language models and
				fail to capture the underlying semantics of the tweets. My thesis addresses this weakness using a novel knowledge based approach that does
				not require any training data set. This approach uses Wikipedia, a crowd sourced knowledge-base, to extract entities relevant to a city. 
				We score the relevance of each local entity with respect to the city, using the Wikipedia Hyperlink Graph. We predict the most likely location
				of the user by matching the scored entities of a city and the entities mentioned by users in their tweets.

			<h2>2. Temporal Reasoning in Medical Data</h2>
			<p align="justify">
				In the summer of 2013, I completed a 3 months internship at <a
					href="http://www.ezdi.us">ezDI</a>. ezDI provides products that
				organize, store and analyze medical data in near real time and embed
				the results of the analytics into a hospital's clinical workflow.
				Computer Assisted Coding simplifies the task of transforming medical
				diagnoses and procedures to universally accepted code numbers by
				automatically generating codes from the evidence gathered from the
				various medical documents of a patient. To increase the accuracy of
				CAC, a method to identify temporality of medical concepts was
				required. I used Random Forest Classifier along with dependency
				relationship between words to identify explicit temporal expressions
				and the medical concepts associated with them. My work was included
				in the final product released in October 2014.

			<h2>3. Traffic Analytics</h2>
			<p align="justify">Traffic congestions have become a major issue
				in many cities around the world with serious economic and social
				implications. City infrastructure in general (e.g., road network,
				water network, power grid) has been under constant pressure to serve
				the needs of its citizens. With more than half the world's
				population living in cities by 2030, the condition is going to get
				worse. At Kno.e.sis researches work on understanding city issues
				such as traffic problems to provide insights to decision/policy
				makes. There are many challenges in dealing with city data such as
				heterogeneity, volume, velocity, and veracity.</p>
			<p align="justify">I worked on the data management part of this
				project by designing a scalable infrastructure for handing the
				sensor data in Mongo DB. The data includes speed, volume, occupancy,
				delay, travel time, link(a predetermined segment of a road is
				referred to as link) etc are available every minute. Apart from
				this, static information like route details, schedules, fares etc
				and event information (scheduled and active) with the location and
				time are also provided. I also designed a visualization interface
				that can be used by researchers, city authorities, or citizens to
				view trends in traffic data.</p>




			<h2>4. PREDOSE</h2>
			<p align="justify">
				<a href="http://wiki.knoesis.org/index.php/PREDOSE">PREDOSE</a> is
				an inter disciplinary research project aimed at developing
				techniques to facilitate prescription drug abuse epidemiology,
				related to the illicit use of pharmaceutical opioids. As a part of
				this project, I assisted in the identification of sentiments from
				online blogs. The goal was to identify trending positive or negative
				sentiments associated with specific drugs with research interest.
